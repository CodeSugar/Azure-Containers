# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a project to showcase containers using Terraform and Azure Container Instances. The repository is currently in its initial state with minimal setup.

## Project Structure

The repository is currently minimal and appears to be in the early stages of development. Future development will likely include:
- Terraform configuration files for Azure infrastructure
- Container definitions and configurations
- Azure Container Instance specifications

## Development Notes

Since this project involves Terraform and Azure Container Instances, future development will likely require:
- Terraform CLI for infrastructure management
- Azure CLI for Azure resource management
- Docker for container operations

The project structure and development commands will need to be updated as the codebase grows and specific tooling is implemented.
